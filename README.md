# HolidayDates
this repository contains code that will output next year's dates for Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and 4th of July.
Of course three of these holidays never change the actual day they fall on. The other three were a bit more tricky to code.
Use however you'd like; I used this code in an auto process to determine holiday pay for employees.
